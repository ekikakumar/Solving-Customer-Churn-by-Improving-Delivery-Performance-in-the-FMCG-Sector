# Solving-Customer-Churn-by-Improving-Delivery-Performance-in-the-FMCG-Sector
Analyzed delivery performance for an FMCG company using SQL, Excel and Power BI. Focused on On-Time, In-Full (OTIF) metrics to identify delivery inefficiencies and recommend improvements in inventory, planning and performance.

Problem Statement:

AtliQ Mart, a growing FMCG company in Gujarat, observed that key customers did not renew their 
annual contracts due to delivery-related service issues. Management suspects that essential 
products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full, leading to poor customer 
satisfaction and ultimately customer churn. To address this, the supply chain analytics team was 
tasked with analyzing On-Time (OT), In-Full (IF), and On-Time In-Full (OTIF) service levels for all 
customer orders on a daily basis against the target service level set for each customer. 

Project Objectives:

 - Analyze FMCG delivery performance data using SQL and Power BI
 - Evaluate key supply chain metrics: On-Time (OT), In-Full(IF), On-time In-Full (OTIF) and delivery reliability
 - Identify delivery inefficiencies contributing to customer churn
 - Detect low-performing products, partners, and regions
